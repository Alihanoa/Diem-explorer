# Meeting 14.05.2021  

Time: 15:00 â€“ 17:25  
Persons: Alihan, Daniel, Tevfik, Tim  

## Discussed topics/doings:   
#### 1. C4 Container Diagram for the MVP:
- we intensively discussed how we could change the containers and relations of the
  diagram so the 'inside' of the Diem Explorer is represented correctly for the MVP
- we tried to follow and compare to the example of the Container Diagram on the C4-website   
- one of some topics on which we disagreed for a long time was whether the user should
  also be defined as a developer, because in realtion to the MVP the developer has to start
  the main method (there's no GUI etc. yet), the user isn't able to do it, so the question
  arises if there is a relation (interaction) between user and API application at all
#### 2. 'My first client'-tutorial:
- we started to deal with the 'My first client'-tutorial on the diem-website
- to our chagrin we had to realize that it is more complicated as we thought
- many applications had to be installed on the Ubuntu subsystem and other things had to be
  looked up because of occured difficulties

## Tasks to be done until the next meeting:  
- continuing the 'My first client'-tutorial
