Meeting 05.05.2021

Time: 16:00 – 17:55
Persons: Alihan, Daniel, Tevfik, Tim

Discussed topics/doings: 
1.	C4 / UML diagram for the MVP:
-	we presented and discussed every diagram
-	criticism on Daniel’s diagram: not directly related to the MVP,
            definition ‘Diem Payment System – interested Person’ isn’t suitable (better: user)
-	criticism on Alihan’s diagram: wasn’t done according to the guidelines of UML or C4 (mixture of both),
            number and definitions of actors don’t fit (user of the Diem network/validator/user of the Diem explorer),
            transactions on the MVP-testnet are fulfilled by two users (no more)
-	criticism on Tevfik’s diagram: wasn’t done according to the guidelines of a
            C4 System Context diagram (too detailed), term ‘Client’ could be unsuitable,
            a person isn’t able to perform transactions or smart contracts with the Diem explorer,
            there’s no database (blockchain is the database)
-	we decided to take a improved version of Daniel’s diagram as the System Context Diagram and
            a improved version of Alihan’s diagram as the Container diagram for our MVP
-	Component and Code diagram are developed in the future when we know more about the
            technical realization and implementation
2.	Methods of the Diem-libraries and test network:
-	we took a look at some of the Diem-classes and their methods and ran a simple main-class built by
            Alihan to test a couple of them and look at their output
-	we informed us about the test validator network and how to implement it
-	Alihan started to initialize the network using Docker

Tasks to be done until the next meeting:
-	everybody: inform, initialize and test the test validator network
-	Alihan: rework the diagram
-	Daniel: rework the diagram
