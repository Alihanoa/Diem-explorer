Persons: Alihan, Daniel, Tevfik, Tim  

## Discussed topics/doings:   
#### 'My fisrt client'- and 'My first transaction'-tutorials:
- we finished to install all components for the Diem-testnet (related to the tutorials)
  on every of our devices
- during the installation and initialization many issues poped up, which we mostly fixed
- we ran the examples of the tutorials and tried some transactions and queries
- we looked up if the transactions and clients we created were stored and found out,
  that it's not the case
- we started to thinkt about how we could build up a connection between our IDE and the testnet,
  but didn't identified a solution yet
  
## Tasks to be done until the next meeting:  
- install the public full node on each device using docker
- think about/research how we could make the testnet with all of its data persistent
