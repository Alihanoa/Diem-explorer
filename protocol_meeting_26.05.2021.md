# Meeting 26.05.2021  

Time: 16:20 â€“ 18:30  
Persons: Alihan, Daniel, Tevfik, Tim  

## Discussed topics/doings:   
#### Troubleshooting docker integration/initializing and running FullNode - part 2:
- Alihan helped Tim and Tevfik to handle their permission-problem and other complications  
  during the initialization of the FullNode via Docker
- Daniel successfully deleted the FullNode and started to initialize the FullNode again
- during the initial synchronization of the FullNode Daniel's laptop crashed,  
  so he wasn't able to execute the whole process
- by the end of the meeting we had achieved that the FullNode was running  
  or at least started to run on all devices, however there were huge issues  
  regarding the available ressources on some of our devices  
  
## Tasks to be done until the next meeting:  
- think about the further steps to get to the MVP
